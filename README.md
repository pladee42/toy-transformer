# toy-transformer
A minimalistic implementation of a transformer language model, optimized for clarity and designed for experimentation.

## Overview

This project focuses on clarity and simplicity, making it easier to understand and modify the transformer architecture without relying on large or highly optimized libraries.

The model is based on the original transformer architecture introduced in [*Attention Is All You Need*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. (2017).

## Features

- **Minimal and readable codebase**  
  Written with educational purposes in mind, using PyTorch and no unnecessary abstractions.

- **Character-level or token-level modeling**  
  Flexible input handling for different types of corpora and experiments.

- **Lightweight and accessible**  
  Suitable for training on a single GPU or even a high-end CPU (for small-scale experiments).

- **Extensible foundation**  
  Designed to support experimentation with architectural variants or new training objectives.

## Use cases

- Educational and research projects
- Demonstrations and workshops on transformer models
- Prototyping new ideas in language modeling
